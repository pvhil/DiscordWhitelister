A easy Discord Bot which adds Minecraft Players to your Minecraft Whitelist.
This Minecraft Plugin/Discord Bot is my first functional code written.
Supports German, English and a custom language!

2. Place .jar file in the Minecraft Server plugins folder
3. After starting the server, The bot created a config.yml file in plugins/DiscordWhitelister.
4. You have to create a Discord Bot by yourself. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications login and create a Application then a Bot. After that, Copy the Bot Token.
5. Insert Bot Token in Config.yml and restart/reload Server
6. (Change "lang" to "en" or "de" or "custom", if you want to use your own text)

# Usage
Write "whitelist MINECRAFT-IGN" in any Discord text channel and you will be added to the whitelist

# Note

Plugin is in alpha and meant for private servers with friends.
My Intention was to remove the pain with whitelisting every member.
